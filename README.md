# ssd.StructuredPrediction

## Rules
- Master branch should contain a normal SSD implementation which can be run with minimal modifications.
- All new approaches and modifications need to be done in a seperate branch. Every branch should contain the required documentation for the branch describing the method used alongwith proper documentations.
